# ShutDownTimer
ShutDownTimer is a simple GUI for the windows "shutdown" command. You can schedule a shutdown and it gives you a handy timer window.

You know when you leave you PC downloading, uploading, or doing whatever, and you don't want to wait for it to complete so you can shut it off? You can schedule a shutdown trought windows cmd, but you'd have to memorize the command, and convert the time you want to seconds. If you want to cancel the shutdown, well, that's another command to memorize. ShutDown Timer does all of that for you while giving you a handy little timer.


# Compilation
Right now, the only way to get it is by either compiling it yourself or running it with <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> installed. Luckly, it is easy to do. Just install AHK from it's website and download the repo. If you want to support me, I'll be selling an easy to use, pre-compiled EXE of it for $.99.
